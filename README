MySQL Databases Tools.  These are some tools that allow you to simply 
view database schemas and create databases for individual users.  These
tools where originally made to make life easier for my college professor.

NOTE:
	In order to create database there must be a corasponding account
on the system.  These tools have only been tested on Linux / CentOS.  They 
will most likely not work on Windows platform.  There is more documentation
in the ./docs directory.  The documentation needs more work.  With that in
mind setup and configuing these tools still should be straight forward.

Good Luck!
